# ML_scripts

This repo contains Google Colab notebooks with ML Scripts.



### Colab Scripts

```
Cross_validation.ipynb - logistic and linear regression on example datasets (iris)

```

```
Regressions.ipynb - simple linear regression models, goodness of fit, polynomial regression

```

```
Titanic_project.ipynb - Based on the Titanic dataset, an optimal model explaining the variable "survived" was created. Data was separated into 80% train and 20% test. Best parameters were found for cross-testing. The operation of the model was tested on on the previously separated 20% of the data.

```

```
breast_cancer_models.ipynb - Models written to decide if a given patient probably has malignant breast cancer. Different numbers of hidden layers and nodes.

```

```
different_regressions.ipynb - Linear and polynomial regressions, standard ridge regression

```

```
gradient_descent.ipynb - The gradient descent algorithm to find the global minimum.

```

```
iris_dataset.ipynb - Comparison of two logistic regression models using the iris dataset (descriptive data)

```

```
iris_dataset2.ipynb - True / False, Positive / Negative table on the Iris dataset; sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and F1 value were calculated

```

```
iris_dataset3_ipynb.ipynb - logistic model with and without regularization with differently selected parameters

```

```
iris_dataset_simple_nn.ipynb - classification neural networks are traine, using the iris dataset yet again


```

```
oil_export_models.ipynb - models created to decide whether a given country exports oil.

```
